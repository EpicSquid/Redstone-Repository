# Redstone Repository (Revolved)
Re-Enhancing the Flux Revolution!

**Description:**

Redstone Repository Revolved is an addon to Redstone Arsenal which adds tools and weaponry which utilize Redstone Flux.
This addon allows you to upgrade these tools to Enderium based tiers for even more power.


**Dependencies:**

- You also need Thermal Foundation, Thermal Expansion, and CoFH Core to play this mod!

This mod is "Revolved" because it was pulled from CurseForge by its creator thundR, who later reposted the mod as MIT. This meant it could be reposted here.
